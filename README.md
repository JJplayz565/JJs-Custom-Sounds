# JJ's Custom Sounds

I made this sound pack that currently adds *43* sound files replacing around ***40*** sounds.  
This sound pack was made with/for [Clementinise](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Clementinise/)'s [CustomSounds](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Clementinise/CustomSounds/) mod(which uses the [LCSoundTool](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/no00ob/LCSoundTool/))

## The Sounds

Some sounds are replaced with memes while some are replaced with me or my friends' voices.  
The target is to replace *almost* every sound in the game with memes.
